          Techwood, perhaps the most politically sensitive terrain in the city,
          is the nation's oldest federal housing project, built during the Great
          Depression, a historic fact that ensured its place on the National
          Register of Historic Places. It occupies 75 acres of prime downtown
          property, bordered on three sides by Coca-Cola headquarters, Georgia
          Tech and the downtown hotel district.

          Techwood Homes was an incredibly dangerous neighborhood that was
          plagued with violence and crime. When Atlanta got the bid for the
          Centennial Olympics, Techwood Homes was one of the first targets
          because it put “too much poverty in one place”. The housing authority
          thought to disperse the poverty by converting the neighborhood to a
          more mixed-income complex.

            <h2>Techwood Flats</h2>
            <p class="overline">the beginning of techwood homes</p>
            <p>
              The area in which Techwood homes was built was originally called
              Techwood flats, a deteriorating slum for low income laborers.
              After the Great Depression, President Herbert Hoover’s
              administration enacted a housing project created to help
              reconstruct cities with poor living conditions.
            </p>
            <p>
              In August 1936, the first residents moved into the renovated
              Techwood homes, the government’s first public housing project.
              Conditions of Techwood homes were pleasant for white families,
              many students of Georgia Tech lived in the area during their
              studies.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, the reconstruction of Techwood flats meant that some of
              the original residents were displaced, about 1,611 families lost
              their homes. Originally, about 80% of the residents in techwood
              flats were african american. (Ruechel) After reconstruction into
              Techwood homes, by national policy, only white residents were
              allowed to move back in.

              Techwood homes remained as an all-white housing project until
              1968, after the civil rights movement. Six years after the
              desegregation of public housing projects, techwood homes’
              residents were 50% African American.
            </p>
            <p>
              The chief executive of Coca-Cola, Paul Austin, was alarmed by this
              and wanted to demolish the area to displace African American
              families farther away from the ‘main hub’ of atlanta. He submitted
              a proposal in 1974 to clear Techwood, relocating it’s residents to
              slums outside the city limits and replacing the property with
              moderate-income housing.

              The plan was almost approved until Maynard Jackson was elected as
              Atlanta’s first Black Mayor and suspended the plan. Jackson
              started a new project in the 1980s to renovate the Techwood homes
              once again, but it wasn’t enough to help the increasing drug usage
              and violence in the community.
            </p>
            <p>
              The public housing community became underfunded, and conditions
              returned to how they were in the early 1930s, when Techwood Homes
              was the Techwood Flats. Money was funneled into white suburbs
              after the ‘white flight’ (where white families fled to suburbs
              outside the city), leaving residents in these areas with little to
              no government assistance to rebuild the techwood homes community.
