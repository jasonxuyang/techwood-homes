            Techwood, perhaps the most politically sensitive terrain in the
            city, is the nation's oldest federal housing project, built during
            the Great Depression, a historic fact that ensured its place on the
            National Register of Historic Places. It occupies 75 acres of prime
            downtown property, bordered on three sides by Coca-Cola
            headquarters, Georgia Tech and the downtown hotel district.

            Techwood Homes was an incredibly dangerous neighborhood that was
            plagued with violence and crime. When Atlanta got the bid for the
            Centennial Olympics, Techwood Homes was one of the first targets
            because it put “too much poverty in one place”. The housing
            authority thought to disperse the poverty by converting the
            neighborhood to a more mixed-income complex.

              <h2>Techwood Flats</h2>
              <p>
                The area in which Techwood homes was built was originally called
                Techwood flats, a deteriorating slum for low income laborers.
                After the Great Depression, President Herbert Hoover’s
                administration enacted a housing project created to help
                reconstruct cities with poor living conditions.
              </p>
              <p>
                In August 1936, the first residents moved into the renovated
                Techwood homes, the government’s first public housing project.
                Conditions of Techwood homes were pleasant for white families,
                many students of Georgia Tech lived in the area during their
                studies.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, the reconstruction of Techwood flats meant that some of
                the original residents were displaced, about 1,611 families lost
                their homes. Originally, about 80% of the residents in techwood
                flats were african american. (Ruechel) After reconstruction into
                Techwood homes, by national policy, only white residents were
                allowed to move back in.

                Techwood homes remained as an all-white housing project until
                1968, after the civil rights movement. Six years after the
                desegregation of public housing projects, techwood homes’
                residents were 50% African American.
              </p>
              <p>
                The chief executive of Coca-Cola, Paul Austin, was alarmed by
                this and wanted to demolish the area to displace African
                American families farther away from the ‘main hub’ of atlanta.
                He submitted a proposal in 1974 to clear Techwood, relocating
                it’s residents to slums outside the city limits and replacing
                the property with moderate-income housing.

            <div>
              <p>
                The plan was almost approved until Maynard Jackson was elected
                as Atlanta’s first Black Mayor and suspended the plan. Jackson
                started a new project in the 1980s to renovate the Techwood
                homes once again, but it wasn’t enough to help the increasing
                drug usage and violence in the community.
              </p>
              <p>
                The public housing community became underfunded, and conditions
                returned to how they were in the early 1930s, when Techwood
                Homes was the Techwood Flats. Money was funneled into white
                suburbs after the ‘white flight’ (where white families fled to
                suburbs outside the city), leaving residents in these areas with
                little to no government assistance to rebuild the techwood homes
                community.
